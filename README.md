# Azure-Cloud-Project
This project demonstrates the end-to-end creation of a cloud data pipeline and reporting solution on Microsoft Azure. The primary goal was to set up secure infrastructure, store and manage data efficiently, and create insightful dashboards in Power BI for visualization and decision-making.

Technologies & Services Used:
  Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): For hosting and managing compute environments.
  Azure Storage Blob: For scalable and secure data storage.
  Azure Key Vault: To securely store and manage sensitive information such as connection strings and secret keys.
  Azure SQL Database: As the central data source for structured storage and querying.
  Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and connecting to the Azure SQL Database for real-time insights.

Implementation Steps:
1.Infrastructure Setup
  Created Virtual Machines to manage workloads.
  Configured networking and security settings.
  
2.Data Storage & Security
  Set up Blob Storage containers for raw and processed data.
  Used Azure Key Vault for securely handling connection strings and credentials.
  
3.Database Connection
  Provisioned an Azure SQL Database.
  Migrated/connected data from Blob Storage.
  Optimized queries for reporting.
  
4.Visualization
  Connected Power BI to Azure SQL Database.
  Built dashboards to visualize business insights and trends.
  Ensured secure access leveraging Key Vault-managed secrets.

5.Key Outcomes:
  Successful demonstration of integrating Azure infrastructure with Power BI analytics.
  Learned hands-on cloud resource provisioning, secure secret management, and data pipeline setup.
  Delivered an interactive, secure, and scalable dashboarding solution.
